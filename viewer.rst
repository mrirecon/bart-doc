There are multiple ways of viewing BART datasets and images. If you are using the Matlab interface, A Matlab-based image viewer which works well with BART is `arrayShow <http://www.biomednmr.mpg.de/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=137&Itemid=43>`_ by Tilman Sumpf.

If you have Python installed, you can view BART datasets using the bartview.py script in the folder `python <https://github.com/mrirecon/bart/tree/master/python>`_ to view the images. The simplest way to use it is to install python through `Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_. To use the script to view a dataset img (with files img.cfl and img.hdr), type the following in the command line::

  $ python bartview.py img
